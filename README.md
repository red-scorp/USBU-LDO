# USBU-LDO Project

The **USBU-LDO** project is a aimed to create low-cost DIY board with microUSB with LDO power supply.

## USBU-LDO Board

The **USBU-LDO** is simple board that provides a microUSB connector and a low-dropout voltage regulator (LDO) to power a small device from a microUSB power source. The board is designed to be as small as possible and to be used in a variety of applications where a small, low-cost, and easy-to-use power supply is needed.

Current design is based on the [LM1117](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm1117.pdf) LDO voltage regulator, which can provide up to 1A of output current at 3.3V. However, the board can be easily modified to use a different LDO voltage regulator if needed.

You can view the [Schematics in PDF format](doc/USBU-LDO.pdf) for detailed information.

STEP 3D file is available [here](doc/USBU-LDO.step).

Features:

- MicroUSB connector for 5V power delivery
- 3.3V LDO voltage regulator up to 1A output current
- LED power indicator

CAM files, as well as the BOM and CPL files for JLCPCB and NextPCB, are available.
